<h1>The &quot;Adaptation&quot; panel</h1>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The &quot;Adaptation&quot; panel is intended for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adapting existing families to work with the 3D Security Designer add-in with the ability to adapt nested families.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adapting existing families to work with the «ARBM_ШаблонПроекта_СПС-СОУЭ_R2019_v1.1.rte» template.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Downloading the «ARBM_ШаблонПроекта_СПС-СОУЭ_R2019_v1.1.rte» template.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Downloading a work guide with the «ARBM_ШаблонПроекта_СПС-СОУЭ_R2019_v1.1.rte» template.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>For an unambiguous understanding of the principles of operation and user interface of the add-in, it is necessary to understand in what sense the following terms are used:</p>
<p><em>Adaptation of families</em> is an additional automatic parameterization of families.</p>
<p><em>Adaptation to the add—in</em> is an additional automatic parameterization of families to ensure work with the 3D Security Designer add-in.</p>
<p><em>Adaptation to the template</em> is an additional automatic parameterization of families to ensure work with the «AER_ШаблонПроекта_СПС-СОУЭ_R2019_v01.rte» template.</p>
<p><em>Embedded family</em> is a downloadable family that is used inside another family with the ability to install dependencies.</p>
<p><em>Family</em> is a group of similar elements that is characterized by a common set of properties and related graphical representations. Each family belongs to one specific category and receives a set of primary parameters from the category. The remaining parameters are set by the user (if necessary).</p>
<p><em>Parametrization</em> is the process of assigning parameters to objects (families).</p>
<p><em>Parameter</em> is a property of Autodesk Revit families. The parameter can be system (set for a specific category at the software level) or user (created by the user). The parameters are used to store and display information about the family. The parameters allow you to change the family without having to edit it in the Family editor. The information can be entered into the parameter during the development of the family by the user, or calculated automatically based on data from the model.</p>
<p><em>Project template</em> is a file with the RTE extension containing a number of settings for project parameters and families used to create new projects.</p>
<p><em>Add—in (plugin)</em> is an independently compiled software module that is dynamically connected to the main program and designed to expand and/or use its capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Collision</em> is a logical, geometric or physical contradiction (or ambiguity) in the user's instructions that makes it impossible to implement these instructions. Before implementing the instructions, the elimination of collisions is required.</p>
<h2>Commands of the &quot;Adaptation&quot; panel</h2>
<p>The Adaptation panel provides commands for performing the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptations of families to the plugin.</li>
<li>Adaptation of families to the template.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The commands from the &quot;Adaptation&quot; panel work only for the following categories of Revit families (in the Autodesk classification):</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Fire alarm&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Security alarm system&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Sensors&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Electrical equipment&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Power electrical appliances&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Communication devices&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Lighting devices&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Devices for calling and notification&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Telephone devices&quot;.</li>
</ul>
