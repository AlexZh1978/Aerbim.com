<h1>The &quot;Delete Elements&quot; command</h1>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> deletion of elements from the circuit is used if it is necessary to exclude elements from the circuit with the deletion of their marks, including alternative ones. The deleted elements no longer belong to the circuit, have no marks, but remain in the project. The deletion of elements from the circuit can be accompanied by an automatic update of marks for remaining elements in the circuit.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> To run the command, click the "Delete Elements" button in the "Actions with Groups of Elements" group on the "Marking" panel of the "3D Security Designer" tab. If no circuits have been created in the current document before, a window will be displayed informing the user about this. </p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> The window control elements are responsible for the following functionality: </p>
<ol>
<li>The &quot;Circuit Name&quot; list allows you to select one of the circuits previously created in the document to remove elements (families) from it.</li>
<li>The &quot;Circuit Mark Format&quot; field gives an idea of the mark format for the selected circuit. The field contains the format name and format structure separated by a colon.</li>
<li>If the &quot;Update Marks for Remaining Elements&quot; checkbox is selected, then after deleting the elements, marks (the order of the elements) and its visual representation for the remaining elements in the circuit will automatically change.</li>
<li>The &quot;Element Marking Statistics&quot; table contains quantitative information about the selected circuit.</li>
<li>The &quot;Delete Elements&quot; button starts the process of removing elements from the selected circuit.</li>
<li>The &quot;Cancel&quot; button cancels the &quot;Delete Elements&quot; command and closes the &quot;Delete Elements from Existing Circuit&quot; window.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> After setting up the logic of the "Delete Elements" command in the "Delete Elements from Existing Circuit" window and clicking the "Delete Elements" button, the removal of elements from the previously selected circuit is started in accordance with the specified settings. In this case, all the elements included in the circuit will be highlighted in green. The status bar will prompt you to select the elements to be removed from the circuit. After selecting the elements to be deleted, click the "Done" button on the options panel to complete the selection. As a result, the selected elements will be removed from the circuit, taking into account the settings made earlier in the "Delete Elements from Existing Circuit" window, and the remaining elements of the circuit will be highlighted. If all elements of the circuit are removed, the circuit will be completely removed from the current project. </p>
