<h1>The &quot;Delete Circuit&quot; command</h1>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> deletion of previously applied marks for all elements assigned by the user to one circuit.</p>
 <p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> When deleting a circuit from the project, the circuit name is deleted, the circuit elements themselves are not deleted from the project. Subsequently, the deleted circuit name can be reused. </p>

Fig. 3. The "Delete Circuit and Marks" window
</p>
 <p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> The window control elements are responsible for the following functionality: </p>
<ol>
<li>The &quot;Circuit Name&quot; list allows you to select one of the circuits previously created in the document to delete marks.</li>
<li>The &quot;Information on Existing Circuits&quot; button allows you to open a window reflecting information about marked circuits in the document.</li>
<li>If the &quot;Delete Alternative Marks&quot; checkbox is selected, then when a mark is deleted from the element (family) the value of the alternative mark (if any) will also be deleted. If the visualization remains, then a question symbol is displayed instead of marking.</li>
<li>If the &quot;Delete Mark Visualization&quot; checkbox is selected, then when deleting a mark from an element (family), its visual representation (if any) will also be deleted.</li>
<li>The &quot;Delete Circuit and Mark&quot; button starts the process of deleting marks for the selected circuit.</li>
<li>The &quot;Cancel&quot; button cancels the &quot;Delete Circuit&quot; command and closes the &quot;Delete Circuit and Marks&quot; window.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> After setting up the logic of the "Delete Circuit" command in the "Delete Circuit and Marks" window and clicking the "Delete Circuit and Mark" button, a window will appear with a request to confirm the circuit deletion. </p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> After confirmation, the process of deleting the mark of the previously selected circuit starts in accordance with the specified settings. At the same time, the "Delete Circuit and Marks" window does not close, but the circuit being deleted disappears from the list of existing circuits and from the current document. You can select and delete circuits in the "Delete Circuit and Marks" window as long as there are available circuits in the list. </p>
