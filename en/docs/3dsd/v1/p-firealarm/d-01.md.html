</p>
 <p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> The command works only on the following types: types of floors, types of ceilings, types of facades, types of sections, 3D views.
To run the command, click the "Sound Alarm" button in the "Fire Alarm" group on the "Fire Alarm" panel of the "3D Security Designer" tab. After that, the window "Choose, Download and Place BIM models (families) of Sound Fire Alarm" will be displayed (Fig. 2). </p>
