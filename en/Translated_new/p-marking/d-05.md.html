<h1>The &quot;Add Elements&quot; command</h1>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> adding elements (families) to an existing circuit is used to insert elements into the specified location of an already existing circuit with automatic updating of the order, marking and visual representation of elements mark in the circuit.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> To run the command, click the "Add Elements" button in the "Actions with Groups of Elements" group on the "Marking" panel of the "3D Security Designer" tab. If no circuits have been created in the current document before, a window will be displayed informing the user about this. </p>

Fig. 3. The "Add Elements to Existing Circuit" window
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> The window control elements are responsible for the following functionality: </p>
<ol>
<li>The &quot;Circuit Name&quot; list allows you to select one of the circuits previously created in the document to add elements (families) to it.</li>
<li>The &quot;Circuit Mark Format&quot; field gives an idea of the mark format for the selected circuit. The field contains the format name and format structure separated by a colon.</li>
<li>If the &quot;Add Before Specified Circuit Element&quot; checkbox is selected, then the addition of elements will occur before the specified element in the circuit. If not, then after.</li>
<li>The &quot;Element Marking Statistics&quot; table contains quantitative information about the selected circuit, including the fields:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Number of elements&quot; is the amount of elements in the circuit, including embedded ones.</li>
<li>&quot;Counter Values in Mark Format&quot; is the maximum amount of numbers provided by mark format.</li>
<li>&quot;Unused Counter Values&quot; is the amount of unused numbers that can be assigned to elements without violating the requirements of mark format.</li>
<li>&quot;Out-of-Range Counter Values&quot; is the amount of elements that lie outside the limits provided by mark format.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>The &quot;Add Elements&quot; button starts the selection of items to be added to the selected circuit.</li>
<li>The &quot;Cancel&quot; button cancels the &quot;Add Elements&quot; command and closes the &quot;Add Elements to Existing Circuit&quot; window.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> After setting up the logic of the "Add Elements" command in the "Add Elements to Existing Circuit" window and clicking the "Add Elements" button, the process of adding elements to the selected circuit starts. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> All elements included in the circuit will be highlighted in green. The status bar will display the query "Specify an element in the circuit relative to which new elements will be added". After selecting this element, it will be highlighted in red and the status bar will prompt "Select elements to be added to the circuit". </p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> Next, select the elements to be added to the selected circuit and click the "Done" button on the parameters panel to complete the selection. As a result, new elements are added to the circuit, with automatic updating of the order, marking and visual representation of the marking of elements in the circuit. All elements of the rebuilt circuit will be highlighted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> Keep in mind that you can only add families of certain categories. The added families must be adapted to work with the "3D Security Designer" add-in. </p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> The following ambiguities are possible when working with the "Add Elements" command: </p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> If, during the process of adding elements to the circuit, the selected elements contain elements that were previously included in other circuits, then the corresponding information window will be displayed, determining the user's further actions. At the same time, the window will display information about the number of elements and the names of the circuits for which there was an ambiguity. If the command continues to work, the numbering of the elements and the visual representation of the marking in the affected circuits will automatically change (if visualization for them was provided earlier) in accordance with the last settings made in the Customize Mark Visualization window. </p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> If, during the process of adding elements to the circuit, the number of selected elements exceeds the number provided by the mark format, the corresponding information window will be displayed, determining the user's further actions. At the same time, information about the number of actually selected elements and the maximum number of elements determined by the mark format will appear in the window. </p>
