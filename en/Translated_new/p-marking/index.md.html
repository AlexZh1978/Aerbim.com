<h1>The &quot;Marking&quot; panel</h1>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> the &quot;Marking&quot; panel is designed for automatic marking of elements logically connected in a circuit. The panel allows you to work with such elements at the level of circuits, groups of elements and individual elements.</p>
<p>Marking elements, i.e., assigning a string value to each element that identifies this element in the project, is one of the most routine operations. Marking is complicated by the fact that during the design process, circuit elements can be either added or removed. This often happens with fire and burglar alarm detectors.</p>
<p>The BIM methodology involves automating such routine processes to avoid collisions and accelerate design, which is achieved with the help of this panel.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>For an unambiguous understanding of the principles of operation and user interface of the add-in, it is necessary to understand in what sense the following terms are used:</p>
<p><em>Mark (noun)</em> is a string value with a user–defined structure that identifies an instance of the Revit family as part of the project, as well as identifying the product corresponding to the family in the design / installation / commissioning, etc. documentation.</p>
<p><em>Mark (verb)</em> means to apply marking</p>
<p><em>Marking</em> is the process of manually or automatically correlating specific Revit families with specific marks.</p>
<p><em>Mark format</em> is a user–defined marking structure. As a rule, the mark contains alphanumeric characters, ordinal numbers, separator characters, etc. in some order.</p>
<p><em>Visualization of marking</em> is the transmission by visual means of information about the marking of the family in the project environment, as well as about the marking of the product corresponding to the family in the design / installation / commissioning, etc. documentation.</p>
<p><em>Circuit</em> is a subset of instances of Revit families in the project, selected by the user, and having the order specified by the user. The order of the families can be used both for marking and for further design of low-current electrical systems, including automated ones.</p>
<p><em>Collision</em> is a logical, geometric or physical contradiction (or ambiguity) in the user's instructions, making it impossible to implement these instructions. Before implementing the instructions, the elimination of collisions is required.</p>
<h2>&quot;Marking&quot; panel commands</h2>
<p>The &quot;Marking&quot; panel provides commands to perform the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marking the circuit according to the pre-selected mark format. Labeling takes into account the presence of embedded families and the multiplicity of addresses for a single device (in the case of BIM-design of address security systems).</li>
<li>Changes to the existing marking in the circuit.</li>
<li>Deleting circuit marks.</li>
<li>Getting information about the marking of the circuit.</li>
<li>Adding marked elements to the circuit.</li>
<li>Deleting marked elements from the circuit.</li>
<li>Alternative mark assignments for circuit elements.</li>
<li>Obtaining information about the mark of the circuit element.</li>
<li>Searching for circuit elements by mark value.</li>
<li>Creation of mark formats.</li>
<li>Mark formats management.</li>
<li>Mark visualization management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The commands from the Marking panel work only for the following categories of Revit families (in the Autodesk classification):</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Fire alarm&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Security alarm system&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Detectors&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Electrical equipment&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Power electronics&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Communication devices&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Lighting devices&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Devices for calling and notification&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Telephone devices&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The marked families must be adapted to the plugin. The adaptation process consists in creating special family parameters. The adaptation process can be automated using the &quot;Adaptation&quot; panel as part of the plugin.</p>
