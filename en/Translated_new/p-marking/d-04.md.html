<h1>The &quot;Information on Existing Circuits&quot; window</h1>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> providing detailed information to the user about the marked circuits in the current document, about the circuits mark formats and the elements included in them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;">The "Information on Existing Circuits" window can be called from the "Change Marks in Existing Circuit" window or from the "Delete Circuit and Marks" window by clicking on the "Information on Existing Circuits" button. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 15px; line-height: 1 em;"> The window control elements are responsible for the following functionality: </p>
<ol>
<li>The &quot;Circuit Name&quot; list allows you to select one of the circuits previously created in the document to view information about it and its elements (families).</li>
<li>The &quot;Circuit Mark Format&quot; field gives an idea of the mark format for the selected circuit. The field contains the format name and format structure separated by a colon.</li>
<li>The &quot;Element Marking Statistics&quot; table contains statistical information about the circuit:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Number of Elements&quot; is the amount of elements in the circuit, including embedded ones.</li>
<li>&quot;Counter Values in Mark Format&quot; is the maximum amount of numbers provided by mark format.</li>
<li>&quot;Unused Counter Values&quot; is the amount of unused numbers that can be assigned to elements without violating the requirements of mark format.</li>
<li>&quot;Out-of-Range Counter Values&quot; is the amount of element numbers that lie outside the limits provided by mark format.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>The &quot;Circuit Elements&quot; table contains information about the elements (families) in the circuit selected for viewing, including the fields:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Marking&quot; — marking of an element in the circuit.</li>
<li>&quot;Alternative marking&quot; — alternative marking of an element in the circuit.</li>
<li>&quot;Model&quot; — the model of the device (as specified in the specifications).</li>
<li>&quot;Name&quot; — the full name of the equipment.</li>
<li>&quot;Number of addresses&quot; — the amount of addresses (for address devices).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>The &quot;Apply&quot; button sets the selected circuit as the current one in the parent window and closes the &quot;Information on Existing Circuits&quot; window.</li>
<li>The &quot;Cancel&quot; button closes the &quot;Information on Existing Circuits&quot; window.</li>
</ol>
